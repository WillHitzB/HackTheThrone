Accounts, Passwords and Authentication (Digital Identity)



			1. What an “Account” Really Is

An account is not just a username and password. That’s the cartoon version.
An account is a contract between you and a system that says:
“This digital entity represents me, and actions done through it are assumed to be mine.”

Every account has three hidden layers:
	Identity claim – “I am HIM”
	Authentication proof – “Here is evidence”
	Authorization – “Here is what I’m allowed to do”
If authentication fails, the system cannot tell you from an attacker. It doesn’t care about intent. Computers are very literal and emotionally vacant.

A website never knows it’s you.
It only reaches a confidence level.

Example:
Correct password → high confidence
Correct password + phone OTP → higher confidence
New device + wrong location → confidence drops

Authentication is about risk management, not certainty.
That’s why you sometimes get security alerts, Logins are blocked on unfamiliar devices and Extra verification appears randomly

The system is constantly asking:
“How likely is this person the real owner?”



			2. Passwords: Ancient, Flawed, Still Everywhere
			
Passwords exist because they are cheap, simple and Human-readeble.
But they are also 
	Guessable
	Reusable
	Phishable 
	Forgettable
	
A password is shared knowledge. And when someone else knows it, the ownership is lost.

Strength is not about looking complex. It’s about search space.

Length beats comlexity
Random beats clever

example:
P@ssw0rd! → weak (predictable pattern)
correcthorsebatterystaple → strong (long, random, memorable)

Attackers don't "guess" manually. They use:
	Brute force - trying all possible combinations
	Dictionary attacks - common words and pattern
	Credential surfing - leaked passwords from other sites
 
Reusing passwords is how breaches chain together.



			3. Password Storage (What Happens After You Type It)

Well-designed systems never store your actual password.
Instead the password is run through a hash function and the hash is stored. During login, the hash is compared.
Good hash functions:
	Are one-way
	Are slow (on purpose)
	Use salts (random data added to prevent rainbow tables)

When you hear “passwords leaked,” it usually means hashes leaked, which attackers then try to crack offline.

			
Humans are terrible at randomness and memory.			
			
Password managers:
	Generate long random passwords
	Store them encrypted
	Reduce reuse		
			
This creates a single point of failure, but one well guarded vault beats 50 weak doors.
Modern managers use strong encryption and zero-knowledge design



			4. Authentication Factors: The Three Proof Types
			
Authentication relies on factors:

1.Something you know - Passwords, PINs
2.Something you have - Phone, hardware key, smart card
3.Something you are - Fingerprint, face, iris

Security improves when factors are independent.
	
Two-Factor and Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA)
2FA means using two different factor types.
Examples:
	Password + SMS code
	Password + authenticator app
	Password + hardware key

Not all 2FA is equal.			

Weak - SMS (can be SIM-swapped)
Stronger - Time-based authenticator apps
		 - Push notifications with confirmation
Strongest - Hardware security keys (FIDO/U2F)			
			
			
			
			5. Authentication Apps and Time-Based Codes
			
Authenticator apps use TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords).
How it works:
	App and server share a secret key
	Both generate a code based on current time
	Codes expire every ~30 seconds

Advantages:
	Offline generation
	Resistant to phishing (mostly)

Backup codes exist because losing the phone is a real risk.			
			
Biometrics feel futuristic, but they have trade-offs.
Pros:
	Fast
	Hard to guess
	No memory required

Cons:
	Cannot be changed if compromised
	Often stored locally, not centrally
	False positives and negatives exist

Biometrics usually unlock a device, not authenticate to a server directly.
Your fingerprint often unlocks the password that does the real work.						
			
			
			
			
			6. Sessions, Cookies, and Tokens (The Silent Guardians)
			
After login, you are not constantly re-authenticated.
Instead:
	Server issues a session token
	Stored in cookies or local storage
	Token proves “already logged in”

If someone steals your session token, then your Password is irrelevant, They are you until the session expires

This is why Public computers are dangerous and HTTPS matters (prevents token sniffing)			
“Log out everywhere” exists due to this.

Modern systems use contextual authentication.
They look at:
	Device fingerprint
	Location
	Typing patterns
	Login time

This is called risk-based authentication.
If behavior deviates:
	Extra verification is triggered
	Access may be blocked
You don’t see this happening, but it’s always running.
			
			
			
			7. Account Recovery: The Weakest Link
			
Most accounts are lost not by hacking, but by recovery abuse.
Recovery methods include:
	Email reset links
	Security questions
	Backup codes

Security questions are notoriously weak:
	Answers are guessable
	Information is public or social-engineered

Email becomes the root account.
Lose email access → lose everything.

Account Takeover: What Actually Happens

A typical takeover chain:
	Phishing steals credentials
	Attacker logs in
	Changes recovery email/password
	Locks out the real user

Speed matters. Most damage happens in minutes.

Attackers then reset other accounts and steal money or/and try to spread scams.



			8. Zero Trust and the Modern Direction
			
Modern security follows Zero Trust:
Never trust, always verify.

This means:
	Every access request is checked
	Internal networks are not assumed safe
	Identity becomes the new perimeter

Authentication is no longer a one-time event—it’s continuous.

(Remember This)

	Passwords prove knowledge
	Authentication proves likelihood
	Accounts represent authority
	Identity is probabilistic
	Recovery paths define real security

You don’t “log in once.”
You constantly maintain trust.
Your digital identity is not stolen in dramatic hacks.
It leaks through:
	Reuse
	Laziness
	Urgency
	Poor recovery design

Security is boring because it works.
Flashy systems fail. Quiet discipline survives.
