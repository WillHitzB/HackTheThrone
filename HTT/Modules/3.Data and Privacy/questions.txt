Case Study 1: The Complacent User

Scenario:
Riya has strong passwords, a password manager, and 2FA on all her accounts. She ignores security alerts, never checks recovery options, and shares her email with multiple apps indiscriminately. One day, a minor breach occurs on one of the apps she used. Attackers leverage old metadata and recovery paths to gain access to her email and several other accounts.

Question:
What best explains why Riya’s accounts were compromised despite strong authentication?

A. Strong passwords alone are enough to protect accounts
B. She ignored structural and systemic risks, such as account recovery and data exposure
C. 2FA is ineffective
D. Metadata cannot be exploited

Answer: B

Case Study 2: The Layered Defender

Scenario:
Arjun uses unique, strong passwords with a password manager, enables hardware-based 2FA where possible, regularly reviews app permissions, and limits the personal data he shares online. He occasionally receives login alerts from unusual locations but verifies them before taking action. One day, a breach occurs on a service he uses, but his accounts remain secure, and no personal data is misused.

Question:
Which principle of digital survival does Arjun exemplify?

A. Security is only about strong passwords
B. Risk management through layered defenses and proactive monitoring
C. Ignoring alerts improves efficiency
D. Metadata does not matter if passwords are strong

Answer: B
